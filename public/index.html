                    <p>While Trailblazer offers you abstraction layers for all aspects of Ruby On Rails, it does not missionize you. Wherever you want, you may fall back to the "Rails Way" with fat models, monolithic controllers, global helpers, etc. This is not a bad thing, but allows you to step-wise introduce Trailblazer's encapsulation in your app without having to rewrite it.<br/>Trailblazer is all about structure. It helps re-organize existing code into smaller components where different concerns are handled in separated classes. Forms go into form objects, views are object-oriented MVC controllers, the business logic happens in dedicated domain objects backed by completely decoupled persistence objects</p>

                    <p>INTRODUCING LOTUS It's about a decade that we use Ruby for the web. Some of the products of these years have tons of messy code, slow builds and painful upgrades to deal with. If your application uses fat models AND fat controllers, you've got the point.<br/>Lotus is a minimal, but yet powerful framework that is focused on good object oriented design, testability and speed. You will learn about the patterns that it implements to solve these problems and to push Ruby performance to the limit. We need new ideas to evolve as a Community and as individuals. Good news are that you can apply them on today. Let's talk together!</p>

                    <p>IDEA → STICKIES → GREEN BAR. While many developers focus on improving development speed, there’s a whole world of improvement that can be unlocked by focusing on quicker understanding of the project domain. In this talk we’ll see how a different approach to requirement gathering - EventStorming - can be used to cross the chasm between stakeholders and developers, leading to better software faster.</p>

                    <p>WHAT IF CLEAN CODE IS A SCAM? It seems that we are keen to follow charismatic leaders who tell us how to do stuff. There are already a lot of rules and principles that we take for granted instead of asking questions: Will this really improve my code? Will it help me deliver faster/more reliably in the long run? It seems that sometimes we fail to challenge their ideas. Maybe you can have too many classes? What if your methods don't need to fit in a tweet? Maybe Object Oriented design as a whole is a case of premature optimisation? What if we just waste time writing tests for everything? Maybe cucumber is a massive overkill? What if... DHH was right? Then again, he is also a charismatic leader...</p>

                    <p>CLOJURESCRIPT + REACT.JS: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BROWSER Over the last few years, there has been a stronger emphasis on functional programming languages and constructs in mainstream programming. The rise of FP popularity is not due to concurrency (although still valid), but the recognition that minimizing side-effects yields to smaller code that is easier to test and reason about. ClojureScript finally brings that perspective to the front-end world. This talk is an introduction to a different kind of front-end development. Together, we will explore how ClojureScript helps accelerate front-end development and how to avoid the most common pitfalls; a molotov cocktail of information and pizazz to put you on the fast-track towards web development nirvana.</p>

                    <p>UNICORN UNIX MAGIC TRICKS This talk is the story of my first encounter with the Unicorn webserver. I was amazed - how would one even build such a piece of software with a master-worker architecture and features like hot-reloading? With magic? Luckily, I found out. In this talk we're going to take a look at Unix from a developer's perspective: forking, pipes, signal handling, sockets. And then we'll take a close look at Unicorn and see how it uses the basic Unix building blocks, these tricks. At the end we're going to see how Unicorn's hot-reloading, preloading and the scaling of processes by signals work. We're going to see that it's not magic, but really just Unix that powers Unicorn.</p>

                    <p>RUBY ALL TEH THINGS - AN INTRO TO MRUBY FOR BUSY PEOPLE You love Ruby, right? Ruby makes you happy. If you could, you’d use nothing else. You use it to run your app. You use it to configure your server. You use it to script your shell. But what about that legacy PHP code? What about your arduino? And what about … LEGO? Well, there’s a Ruby for that. Its name is mruby. It’s small, embeddable and portable. If you heard about it and did not have time to look into it up to now, this talk is for you.</p>

                    <p>RAILS <3 REACT Rails has seen a lot of MVC’s for the V layer itself. May it be Ember or Angular, unless there’s some heavy groundwork, these don’t gel well with existing applications. React JS being framework Agnostic, blows out of these requirements, and being dead simple is far easier to add to existing / new projects. In this talk we’ll do walkthrough on using React in Rails, comparing it over other approaches. Mixing and matching it with Backbone and other frameworks, to get the most out of it, all the while keeping the rails developer far more productive.</p>

            <h2>The mission</h2>

            <p>The main goal of the conference is very clear. We want to help <b>Ruby professionals</b> become better at
                what they do. Wroc_love.rb serves best to people who are already fluent with Ruby. The ideas presented
                at our conference are very advanced. They are meant to inspire the way we write code, the way we help
                our clients and users. It’s not uncommon for us to present you ideas that come from the Java and .NET
                worlds, we believe that their ideas can have a great influence on our community. There are good reasons,
                why our conference is called “the best Java conference in the Ruby world”.</p>
        </header>
        <header class="major">
            <h2>Experiments</h2>

            <p>Our goal is to ensure a good environment to learn and discuss. We love confronting ideas, even when it’s
                uncomfortable to the Ruby status-quo. We love experimenting with new formats of talks and discussions,
                like fights, fishbowls and crowd-moderated discussion panels. Everything that can inspire the Ruby
                programmers is more than welcome at our conference. Let us know, what you’d be interested in
                experimenting with!</p>
        </header>
        <header class="major">
            <h2>Inspiration and safety</h2>

            <p>Conferences are not only about listening. Most of the value comes from talking to each other. Our mission
                is to create an inspiring, thoughtful, creative and safe space to everyone involved. <b>The venue</b> is
                known to be of good quality - it’s a University of Wroclaw building. It has many ways to ensure safety
                of all the people inside like monitoring and special security people.<br/>As part of our goal, we’re
                dedicated to react to all situations that we’ll be notified, ideally directly to us.There will be a <b>special
                    phone number</b>, you can call at any time to let us know about any problem or ask any
                question.<br/>Additionally, there will be a special team of <b>student volunteers</b> who will be
                visible during the conference (If you want to join the team, please let us know). Student volunteers are
                here to help find your way around and resolve any problem. It is needless to say that this conference is
                a place for good people, only. Good people respect each other, are nice to each other, smile, and make
                everyone (without exceptions) feel comfortable.</p>

            <h2>Who we are</h2>

            <p>Wroc_love.rb started as an activity of the DRUG (Wroclaw User Group) organization. However, over time,
                people loved it so much that the organization team grew to much more than that. Wroc_love.rb is now
                organized by Rubyists from many different Polish regions.</p>

            <h2>Supporters</h2>

            <p>If you like our mission, then you can help us by buying a special supporter ticket. It’s 600 EUR. This
                ticket guarantees your logo on the website and on the videos. Your company would join other already
